Tested using random outputs and set environment variable RUST_BACKTRACE=full according the program's hint to get the full backtrace. Despite the PIE the last 3 hex values of functions are always the same, therefore I used the last 3 bytes combined with known address at __libc_start_main to identify each backtrace. Found function FUN_001067f0 that checks the input values and provides output respectively. The filter checks whether the input is at least 10 chars long and if each input is a digit. It then goes through all digits except the last performing some arithmetic operation and checks if the result equals to the last digit; flag will be produced if it does. I don't have to understand the aforementioned arithmetic operations: since the first few digits will always produce the same arithmetic result if they remain the same, I only have to brute force the last digit until I got the flag. I fixed the first nine digits to 100000000 and brute forced until I got 1000000008 that give the flag. No program is needed since only maximum 10 tries are needed
