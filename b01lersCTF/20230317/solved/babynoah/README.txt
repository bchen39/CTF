The program takes in 8 lines of input, each of 24 chars, and performs some operation according to the value of each input: it first either modifies the buffer located at 0x4038 or increments/decrements the pointer on the input, then adds the input value+1 to int located at 0x4030. Finally the program checks if the int at 0x4030 equals to 0x31337 and produces the flag if it does. 
For this program, since only 8 lines * 24 chars space is provided and the maximum int available in a char is 0x7f (127), I need to run through the input buffer multiple times in order to sum the value enough times for the target value. I devised a plan to manipulate buffer 0x4038 so that it outputs the ending character (@) after some runs through the input buffer: Each time the entire input buffer is checked, the program will first move the 3rd value of the input to buffer 0x4038, add 8 to it and put it back. This process will repeat a few times until the input becomes 0x40 (@) which will signify the end of program and compare 0x4030 to 0x31337. I also manipulated the direction pointers ">, v, <, ^" so that the input loops. Lastly, I tweaked the input values so that the sum is exactly 0x31337.
