While ASLR is enabled, no protection is put on the environment variables, making it possible to perform a NOP sled attack using environment variable. I first created an environment variable which includes a large amount of NOP and the shellcode. Then I found the approximate address of the environment variables using gdb, which I will put as the return address. Since the NOP sled is very long (~100000 bytes) after running the program a few times, we will manage to hit the NOP despite the ASLR. Please see details in my code.
